# ThessErasmus

This repository contains a website that allows users to search for and view locations on a map. The website uses the Google Maps API to display the map and search for locations.

## Getting Started

To view the website, simply clone or download the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Features

- The website includes a map that is centered on Thessaloniki, Greece.
- Users can enter a location in the search bar and the map will display the location and provide information such as the address and nearby businesses.
- The map includes markers for popular locations in Thessaloniki, such as the White Tower and Aristotle Square.
- The website is responsive and will adjust to fit different screen sizes.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add additional features to the website such as:

- The ability for users to add their own markers and descriptions for locations.
- The ability to switch between different map views, such as satellite and street view.
- The ability to display real-time traffic information on the map.
