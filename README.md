This repository contains a website that allows users to search for and view locations on a map. The website uses the Google Maps API to display the map and search for locations.

## Getting Started

To view the website, simply clone or download the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Features

- The website includes a search bar for users to enter a location.
- The map will display the location and provide information such as the address and nearby businesses.
- Users can use the map to zoom in and out, as well as pan around to view different areas.
- The website is responsive and will adjust to fit different screen sizes.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add additional features to the website such as:

- The ability for users to save their favorite locations and view them on the map.
- The ability to display directions and estimates for travel time between locations.
- The ability to view different map styles and layers, such as satellite and traffic.

## Credits
